## About Me

Hi, I am Zixuan (Eve) Yi. I am a first-year CS PhD student at University of Pennsylvania, advised by [Ryan Marcus](https://rmarcus.info/blog/) and [Zack Ives](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~zives/). Before this, I earned my bachelor degree in CS from Tsinghua University.

You can find me at Twitter [@yi_zixuan](https://twitter.com/yi_zixuan),  [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zixuan-yi-073ab01b0/) or email me [zixy@seas.upenn.edu](mailto:zixy@seas.upenn.edu). 

## News

üá®üá± I will be attending the SIGMOD'24 Conference at Santiago, Chile. 

‚òÅÔ∏è I will be interning at the [SystemsResearch@Google](https://techsysinfra.google/research/) in 2024 Summer.

## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in Databases and Machine Learning System.

Low Rank Approximation for Learned Query Optimization.  \

<em>TLDR: Regressions and large overhead time are the major concerns when machine learning based query optimizers are put into production system. We proposed the first "workload-level" query optimizer that optimize the whole workload all at once without any regressions. Leveraging the similarities between queries, we cast the problem as low-rank matrix completion - using this pure linear method gives us 100x overhead time gain!</em>
